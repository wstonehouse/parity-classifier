# Parity Classifier

## Author: Will Stonehouse Salinas

## About

This is a nerual network simulation that performs a parity (odd/even) judgement on input units

If the number of input units turned on is even, then the model will output a 1

If the number of input units turned on is odd, then the model will output a 0

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to construct a neural network from scratch. This means generating
the stimuli myself and implementing mathematical models for neural networks without any MATLAB toolboxes.
I was motivated by learning how neural networks mathematically work at the lowest of levels.
